# GitHub Copilot Instructions for BlacknWhite Project

## Purpose
This file provides guidelines and best practices for using GitHub Copilot in the BlacknWhite board game project.

## Coding Style
- Follow PEP8 for Python code formatting.
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Add docstrings to all classes and public methods.

## Project Structure
- Game logic is in the `game/` directory.
- Test scripts are in the project root (e.g., `test_board.py`, `test_stats.py`).

## Copilot Usage
- Use Copilot to suggest code for board game logic, test automation, and statistics.
- Review and edit Copilot suggestions for correctness and clarity.
- Prefer Copilot completions that:
  - Use existing classes (`Board`, `Square`).
  - Integrate with the current codebase structure.
  - Avoid duplicating code or logic already present.

## Testing
- Use Copilot to generate test cases and simulation scripts.
- Ensure all new features are covered by tests.

## Documentation
- Use Copilot to help generate docstrings and comments.
- Summarize new features and changes in code comments.

## Miscellaneous
- Do not commit Copilot-generated code without review.
- Report any issues or bugs found in Copilot suggestions.
